# iOS Shortcuts Compilation

Welcome to my collection of iOS Shortcuts! This repository contains various shortcuts I’ve created to enhance productivity, automate tasks, and simplify everyday processes on your iPhone but it works in any iOS device with the **shortcuts app** installed.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific shortcut or a group of related shortcuts. Inside each folder, you will find:

- A `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to use the shortcut.
- A direct link to download the shortcut via iCloud.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the folders to find the shortcut you’re interested in.
2. Open the `README.md` file inside the folder to read the instructions.
3. Use the provided iCloud link to download the shortcut directly to your iOS device.

## Feedback & Contributions
