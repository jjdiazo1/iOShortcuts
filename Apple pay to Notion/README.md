This shortcut allows you to log your Apple Pay transactions directly into a Notion database. It's a seamless way to track your expenses with a quick tap.

## How It Works
- When you tap your card using Apple Pay, the transaction details are logged into a Notion database.
- The shortcut fetches your transaction data and sends it to the Notion API, which records it in a specific Notion database.

## Prerequisites

1. **Notion API Key**: You need to generate a Notion API key to allow this shortcut to send data to your Notion workspace.
2. **Database ID**: The ID of the database where the transactions will be logged.
