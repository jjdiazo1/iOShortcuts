This shortcut allows you to log your Apple Pay transactions directly into your Apple Notes app, making it easy to keep track of your expenses without having to configure any external API.

## How It Works
- When you tap your card using Apple Pay, the transaction details are automatically logged into a note in the Apple Notes app.
- Unlike the Notion version, no external setup or API configuration is required. Everything is managed within the Notes app.

## Prerequisites

It's important that you set this shortcut as a transaction automation. Without automation, the shortcut wonâ€™t trigger automatically after a transaction.

### How to Configure the Shortcut

Refer to this guide for how to set up an automation:
